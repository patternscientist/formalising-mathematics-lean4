# Formalising Mathematics in Lean4

My solutions to Kevin Buzzard's [Formalising Mathematics 2024](https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/formalising-mathematics-2024/) course (Imperial College London / Oxford), worked through independently.

## Progress

| Section | Topic | Sheets | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|--------|
| 01 | Logic (→, ∧, ∨, ¬, ↔, ∀, ∃) | 6 / 6 | ✅ Complete |
| 02 | Real Numbers | 5 / 6 | 🔧 Sheet 6 in progress |
| 03 | Functions (injective, surjective, bijective) | 2 / 3 | 🔧 Sheet 3 in progress |
| 04 | Sets (∈, ⊆, ∪, ∩, set equality) | 4 / 6 | 🔧 Sheets 4, 6 in progress |

Files named `SheetNCompleted.lean` are finished; files named `SheetN.lean` are in progress.

## Tactics Used

`intro`, `exact`, `apply`, `rw`, `simp`, `ring`, `constructor`, `cases'`, `left`, `right`, `ext`, `induction`, `obtain`, `use`, `push_neg`, `by_contra`, `linarith`, `norm_num`, `rcases`, `rintro`, `tauto`

## Background

I'm a Stanford mathematics major (discrete math / CS theory concentration). I worked through these exercises in 2025 to build fluency with Lean4 and Mathlib as part of a broader interest in formal verification and proof automation. I'm a founding officer of Stanford's AI for Lean4 Club.
